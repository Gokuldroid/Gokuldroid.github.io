title: Show me your projects graveyard!
---
Some of us might have come across very crazy ideas throughout our programming career. when I started my programming career, I didn't know open source and benefits of it back then. I didn't know the best practices and SDLC etc. I have written some shit code to get the things done. I don't even have source code for some of those projects now.I wanted to develop some of these things just to learn even if some opensource version available out there. still I am doing this. but still those projects remind me about my progress from a newbie to senior software developer at [Freshworks](https://freshworks.com/).

**FLAMES**

For those who don't know what flames check out this [link](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-%22Flame%22).
I developed a GUI application using java and I had two input boxes and a button. fairly simple application. but it took me a day to build back then. In that simple application also, I faced the null pointer exception for some inputs. I didn't bother to fix it as it worked very well for my name and all of my crush's name. my job is done.

***Tools used: Java, netbeans***

**Calculator**

A simple Java GUI application. I got some wired errors due to integer overflow. I didn't know how to solve it, thus my application input was limited to Long.MAX_VALUE. I could have used BigInt to support some really big numbers. But I was limited by the technology of my time (complete reference java :P).

***Tools used: Java, eclipse***

**Syllabus app**

My first widely used android app by my college friends. An app containing all my college syllabus. It had tab view and dropdown view and lots of text views. I didn't know about DB and content management system when I developed this app. So I hardcoded all data into android layouts (every subject, every semester had a xml layout). that's shit lots of work. But I got lots of positive reviews. I released my app on Facebook as I didn't have a play store account at that time. It is deeply buried in [FB feed](https://www.facebook.com/gokul.prabhu.droid/). you can search for it if you're bored.

***Tools used: Java, eclipse with ADT plugin***

**TicTocToe**

An app to play tic-tac-toe over bluetooth.I did complete testing with lots of phones. surprisingly it worked very well in most of the phone. I released this app also in FB. I changed my email, username everything to Gokuldroid because of craze I had on android.

**Kurukshetra app**

I developed this app for my college tech fest. My first app to reach 2k downloads in play store (P.S: Not my account).

***Tools used: Java, Android studio beta***

**The Hindu news reader**

My first app to use a backend system. I built using the RSS feed of the Hindu newspaper website. 

***Tools used: Java, Android studio beta***

**Secure bay**

Phone lock screen app that captures the face using the front camera if you enter the password wrongly. I wanted to use pattern unlock but I didn't know how to develop a gesture-based app. source code can be found [here](https://github.com/Gokuldroid/SecureBay).

***Tools used: Java, Android studio beta***

**Vision website**

I developed this site after watching lots of tutorials on youtube and reading lots of books about PHP, angular js (very old version). It is not a responsive one. it will break if you view in mobile phone. I purchased a Godaddy account with the fund I got from my college. I also used Godaddy account's ssh access as socks proxy to bypass my college wifi restrictions.source code can be found [here](https://github.com/Gokuldroid/Vision).

***Tools used: PHP, angular js, sublime***
