I decided to use some static site builders to get it done quickly. </p>\n<p>I am already using <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">gatsby</a> for my <a href=\"http://codefromdude.com/\">blog</a>. I thought of building my gatsby theme as I am pretty much satisfied by Gatsby. but it takes lots of time. </p>\n<p>In this post, I will share my opinions on documentation tools that I have considered for my project. </p>\n<p><strong>My requirements are:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appearance should align with my product theme.</li>\n<li>It should be user friendly as I am going to use it for one of my android apps (not just for developers).</li>\n<li>It should be SEO friendly.</li>\n<li>Now I don't have any complex requirements. but it should be extendable in the future.</li>\n<li>It should be hostable in GitHub pages using a new repo other than my personal page repo. I didn't want to pollute my blog with docs logic as I might add few more docs for some other projects.</li>\n<li>It shouldn't require much configuration/learning for up and running. </li>\n<li>It should be simple.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://brainhubeu.github.io/gatsby-docs-kit/\">Gatsby-docs-kit</a>:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Based on gatsby.   </li>\n<li>Easily customizable.   </li>\n<li>We can host it on GitHub.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Too much to do for documentation.</li>\n<li>Not SEO friendly. but we can configure using plugins available for gatsby. (I didn't want to do that again for docs).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://docsify.js.org/#/?id=docsify\">Docsify</a>:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy to set up.</li>\n<li>Comes with four predefined themes. we can easily create our own themes using this <a href=\"https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/docsify-themeable/#/quick-start?id=hosting\">tool</a>.</li>\n<li>Configurable using plugins. we can write our plugins too.</li>\n<li>We can build it and host it GitHub.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not SEO friendly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.gitbook.com/\">GitBook</a></strong> : (<em>I want to try this in future</em>):</p>\n<p>Some sample sites using Gitbook <a href=\"https://docs.timber.io/\">Timber</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>SEO friendly.</li>\n<li>No need to set up in our local machine. It is free for personal use.</li>\n<li>It comes with powerful analytics.</li>\n<li>Drag and drop UI. </li>\n<li>It requires less programming knowledge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vendor lockdown.</li>\n<li>We're limited by the customization they provide.</li>\n<li>We can't host it on our own.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/timberio/gitdocs\">Gitdocs</a>:</strong></p>\n<p>I stumbled up this framework after seeing dev.to's <a href=\"https://docs.dev.to/technical-overview/stack/\">documentation</a>. It is very easy to configure. I felt some limitations from the beginning itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>SEO friendly.</li>\n<li>We can build it and host it GitHub.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No theming support as of now.</li>\n<li>Not maintained very actively (The last commit was made 2 years back). I feel the development has been stopped.</li>\n<li>My primary GitHub page is <a href=\"https://gokuldroid.github.io\">https://gokuldroid.github.io</a>. If I have another project  the public URL will look like this <a href=\"https://gokuldroid.github.io/%7Bproject_name%7D\">https://gokuldroid.github.io/{project_name}</a>. This setup is not easy with Gitdocs. There are open issues and <a href=\"https://github.com/timberio/gitdocs/pull/172\">PR</a> related to this.</li>\n<li>Not customizable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://daux.io/\">Daux.io</a></strong></p>\n<p>Some sample sites using this framework <a href=\"https://docs.pixolution.org/#/\">pixolution</a> , <a href=\"https://doc.soisy.it/en/Introduction.html\">soisy</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Props:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It has multilingual support.</li>\n<li>We can build it and host it GitHub.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The default theme is not user friendly.</li>\n<li>There is no much documentation for customization. but some sites using this framework has a really good look and feel.</li>\n<li>Only the homepage and documentation page is available. we can't add custom pages.</li>\n<li>Not extendable. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.mkdocs.org/\">MkDocs</a>:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Very popular and actively maintained (10K stars in GitHub)</li>\n<li>Lots of <a href=\"https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Themes\">predefined themes</a> available.</li>\n<li>We can build it and host it GitHub.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Based on python might not work very well with other frontend tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://v2.docusaurus.io/\">Docusaurus</a>:</strong></p>\n<p>There are two major versions of docusaurus. versions two is still in beta and it doesn't have some of the features of version one. but the road map of docusaurus 2 seemed interesting to me. So I wanted to give it a try for my blog.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is maintained by Facebook.</li>\n<li>Easily themeable. It uses <a href=\"https://facebookincubator.github.io/infima\">infima</a> under the hood (Note: this also still in beta).</li>\n<li>It comes with a lot of predefined configurations.</li>\n<li>Lots of facebook's open-source projects use this for documentation.</li>\n<li>It has lots of flexibility.</li>\n<li>We can build it and host it GitHub.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Version 2 still in beta (but it is pretty much stable).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on the observations, I've decided to use docusaurus beta for my app's documentation. You can take a look at the final site <a href=\"https://codefromdude.com/vlc-docs/\">here</a> and source code <a href=\"https://github.com/Gokuldroid/vlc-docs\">here</a>. Let me know, what is your personal choice in documentation tools and why.</p>","excerpt":"I've been trying to write a documentation page for my project (An android app to control your VLC media player) for a very long time.
