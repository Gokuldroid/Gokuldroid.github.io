I didn't know the best practices and SDLC etc. I have written some shit code to get the things done. I don't even have source code for some of those projects now.I wanted to develop some of these things just to learn even if some opensource version available out there. still I am doing this. but still those projects remind me about my progress from a newbie to senior software developer at <a href=\"https://freshworks.com/\">Freshworks</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thumb rule: No one should be using your projects now including you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>FLAMES</strong></p>\n<p>For those who don't know what flames check out this <a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Play-%22Flame%22\">link</a>.\nI developed a GUI application using java and I had two input boxes and a button. fairly simple application. but it took me a day to build back then. In that simple application also, I faced the null pointer exception for some inputs. I didn't bother to fix it as it worked very well for my name and all of my crush's name. my job is done.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tools used: Java, netbeans</em></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Calculator</strong></p>\n<p>A simple Java GUI application. I got some wired errors due to integer overflow. I didn't know how to solve it, thus my application input was limited to Long.MAX_VALUE. I could have used BigInt to support some really big numbers. But I was limited by the technology of my time (complete reference java :P).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tools used: Java, eclipse</em></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Syllabus app</strong></p>\n<p>My first widely used android app by my college friends. An app containing all my college syllabus. It had tab view and dropdown view and lots of text views. I didn't know about DB and content management system when I developed this app. So I hardcoded all data into android layouts (every subject, every semester had a xml layout). that's shit lots of work. But I got lots of positive reviews. I released my app on Facebook as I didn't have a play store account at that time. It is deeply buried in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/gokul.prabhu.droid/\">FB feed</a>. you can search for it if you're bored.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tools used: Java, eclipse with ADT plugin</em></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>TicTocToe</strong></p>\n<p>An app to play tic-tac-toe over bluetooth.I did complete testing with lots of phones. surprisingly it worked very well in most of the phone. I released this app also in FB. I changed my email, username everything to Gokuldroid because of craze I had on android.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tools used: Java, eclipse with ADT plugin</em></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Kurukshetra app</strong></p>\n<p>I developed this app for my college tech fest. My first app to reach 2k downloads in play store (P.S: Not my account).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tools used: Java, Android studio beta</em></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>The Hindu news reader</strong></p>\n<p>My first app to use a backend system. I built using the RSS feed of the Hindu newspaper website. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Tools used: Java, Android studio beta</em></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Secure bay</strong></p>\n<p>Phone lock screen app that captures the face using the front camera if you enter the password wrongly. I wanted to use pattern unlock but I didn't know how to develop a gesture-based app. source code can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/Gokuldroid/SecureBay\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tools used: Java, Android studio beta</em></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Vision website</strong></p>\n<p>I developed this site after watching lots of tutorials on youtube and reading lots of books about PHP, angular js (very old version). It is not a responsive one. it will break if you view in mobile phone. I purchased a Godaddy account with the fund I got from my college. I also used Godaddy account's ssh access as socks proxy to bypass my college wifi restrictions.source code can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/Gokuldroid/Vision\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tools used: PHP, angular js, sublime</em></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Gola: static site generator</strong></p>\n<p>I wanted to experiment on a node js project. this is the result of it.source code can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/Gokuldroid/gola\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tools used: Javascript, nodejs, handlebars, express</em></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Some shit cli tools</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Gokuldroid/cli\">cli</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Gokuldroid/easy-cli\">easy-cli</a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Tools used: Typescript, node js</em></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Easy google play</strong></p>\n<p>A Gradle plugin to publish app. source code can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/Gokuldroid/EasyGooglePlay\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tools used: Kotlin</em></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>OMP DSL</strong></p>\n<p>DSL builder to generate XML entries. source code can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/Gokuldroid/omp-dsl\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tools used: Kotlin</em></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Grunner - A vscode extension</strong> </p>\n<p>source code can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/Gokuldroid/grunner\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tools used: Typescript</em></strong></p>","excerpt":"Some of us might have come across very crazy ideas throughout our programming career. when I started my programming career, I didn't knowâ€¦","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Show me your projects graveyard!","tags":["Personal projects","Side projects","Learnings"]}},"previousPost":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Evaluating documentation frameworks for personal projects."}},"nextPost":{"frontmatter":{"title":"One minute tips : Less noise in SQL joins"}}},"pageContext":{"pageId":"a8828337-5c75-5bba-b790-ec967ba804ad","previousPagePath":"/posts/eval-documentation-frameworks-for-personal-projects/","previousItem":{"node":{"id":"628f4390-b3b8-55a0-b341-d396c58c587b","frontmatter":{"title":"Evaluating documentation frameworks for personal projects.","path":"eval-documentation-frameworks-for-personal-projects","date":"2020-05-03T06:10:35.547Z","categories":["programming"]}}},"previousPageId":"628f4390-b3b8-55a0-b341-d396c58c587b","nextPagePath":"/posts/one-min-tip-less-noice-in-sql-joins/","nextItem":{"node":{"id":"f130aa31-c94d-5dcb-8c4d-8999c2f87c03","frontmatter":{"title":"One minute tips : Less noise in SQL joins","path":"one-min-tip-less-noice-in-sql-joins","date":"2020-02-25T17:29:40.001Z","categories":["database"]}}},"nextPageId":"f130aa31-c94d-5dcb-8c4d-8999c2f87c03"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3128451518"]}
