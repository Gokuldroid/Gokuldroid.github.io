It is named after the ostrich effect which is defined as \"to stick one's head in the sand and pretend there is no problem\". It is used when it is more cost-effective to allow the problem to occur than to attempt its prevention.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>we can very well ignore the length validation since, anyways it will be validated in some other means. although email address RFC standard most likely won't change, maintaining the RFC standard based validation in our code is still and overhead. we can be <code class=\"language-text\">ostrich</code> in this case and pretend there is no problem.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"Ostrich algorithm","date":"2022-10-02T07:58:25.000Z","tags":["algorithm","ostrich algorithm","programming"],"render_in_place":true,"path":"til-ostrich-algorithm"}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Cmd + shift + p -> configure user snippets -> new global snippets -> paste the following snippet -> save -> and type  Supported snippet…","html":"<p>Cmd + shift + p -> configure user snippets -> new global snippets -> paste the following snippet -> save -> and type <code class=\"language-text\">currenttime</code></p>\n\n          <div class=\"gatsby-remark-prismjs-copy-button-container\">\n            <div class=\"gatsby-remark-prismjs-copy-button\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" aria-pressed=\"false\" onclick=\"gatsbyRemarkCopyToClipboard(this, this.parentNode.nextElementSibling)\">\n              Copy\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-json line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\t<span class=\"token property\">\"current time\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\t\t<span class=\"token property\">\"prefix\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"currenttime\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\t\t<span class=\"token property\">\"body\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n\t\t\t<span class=\"token string\">\"$CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-${CURRENT_DATE}T$CURRENT_HOUR:$CURRENT_MINUTE:$CURRENT_SECOND.000Z\"</span>\n\t\t<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\t\t<span class=\"token property\">\"description\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Insert current time\"</span>\n\t<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Supported snippet variables can be found <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_20#_more-snippet-variables\">here</a>.\nMore about <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets\">vs code snippets</a>.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"Insert current time in vs code using snippet","date":"2022-09-15T22:16:11.000Z","tags":["productivity","vs code"],"render_in_place":true,"path":"til-insert-current-time-vs-code"}}}]},"categories":{"group":[{"name":"algorithm","count":1},{"name":"android","count":1},{"name":"blogging","count":1},{"name":"cmdline","count":1},{"name":"database","count":1},{"name":"general","count":1},{"name":"java","count":2},{"name":"personal","count":1},{"name":"productivity","count":5},{"name":"programming","count":6},{"name":"software development","count":2},{"name":"today I learned","count":2},{"name":"tools","count":2}]}},"pageContext":{"category":"today I learned","skip":0,"limit":5,"currentPage":1,"humanPageNumber":1,"numberOfPages":1}},"staticQueryHashes":["3128451518"]}
